## Working with the Processing IDE
> Processing is a flexible software sketchbook and a language for learning how to code within the context of the visual arts. Since 2001, Processing has promoted software literacy within the visual arts and visual literacy within technology. There are tens of thousands of students, artists, designers, researchers, and hobbyists who use Processing for learning and prototyping.

## Setting up a basic Processing sketchbook
Head over to https://processing.org/ and download the IDE (Integrated Development Editor) for Processing. They offer installers for Windows, Mac and Linux systems. The install will create a folder called ``Processing`` in your user directory. In this place we will create little programs that we call "sketches".

## Python, Java, JavaScript
You can choose write your sketch code in Java-Mode, Javascript-Mode and Python-Mode. If you want to be really fancy you can even use Clojure and other languages. My basic recommendation is to use the Java-Mode if you want to create still images or video and the JavaScript-Mode if you want to do something interactive in the browser. Personally I use all the modes to experiment and learn about programming itself.
